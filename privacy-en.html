    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="muted">Effective date: 2025-12-30</p>

    <p>
      This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>Noise Recorder</strong> (“the App”) handles information.
      The App is designed to work <strong>locally on your device</strong>.
    </p>

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>No account required</strong>. We do not ask you to create an account.</li>
      <li><strong>No server upload by default</strong>. Your measurements/recordings stay on your device unless you choose to export/share them.</li>
      <li><strong>No third‑party analytics</strong> in the App (no tracking SDKs).</li>
      <li><strong>Purchases handled by Apple</strong>. Subscription and payment are processed by Apple’s App Store.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Information the App processes</h2>
    <p>
      The App may process the following information to provide features you use:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Microphone input</strong>: used to measure sound levels and (if you start recording) to capture audio.</li>
      <li><strong>Camera input (optional)</strong>: used only if you choose a feature that records video / adds a watermark.</li>
      <li><strong>Photos / media library access (optional)</strong>: used only if you save exported videos/reports to your library.</li>
      <li><strong>Measurement data</strong>: timestamps, decibel values, and settings used to generate reports (stored locally).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How your data is stored</h2>
    <p>
      Data created by the App (such as measurement records, recordings, exported reports) is stored on your device.
      You control whether to export/share files using iOS sharing features.
    </p>

    <h2>Sharing & exports</h2>
    <p>
      If you use iOS sharing/export features, the data you choose to share will be provided to the destination you select
      (for example, Messages, Mail, Files, or a third‑party app). The destination’s privacy practices apply.
    </p>

    <h2>Subscriptions & payments</h2>
    <p>
      The App may offer in‑app purchases (including auto‑renewable subscriptions). Apple processes payments and may
      collect information required to complete purchases. We do not receive your full payment details.
    </p>

    <h2>Children</h2>
    <p>
      The App is not intended for children under the age where parental consent is required.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The effective date above will be updated when changes are made.
    </p>
